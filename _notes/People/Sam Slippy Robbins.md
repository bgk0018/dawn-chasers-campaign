Sam "Slippy" Robbins is a 20 year old human young adult with unkempt curly black hair and crooked teeth. He's dressed in what looks like a mismatch of hand-me-down clothes that mostly fit and an assortment of various weapons, almost as if he had asked for 'one of everything' from the local blacksmith. He's a forgettable face in the crowd and not one that stands out. The only thing that would catch someone's eye is the ornate book he carries chained across his hips.

Sam speaks very heavily at the front of his mouth giving him a nasaly lisp, which is further exacerbated by his fast talking style, making him sound a bit like a squirrely snake.

Sam isn't above bragging and expects that his reputation precedes him, or at least he'll make it known to you if you ask.

# Background

Sam comes from the farms outside Rexxentrum where his grandparents owned a small plot of land. Feeling destined for more than a life farming beets, Sam made his way to Rexxentrum to pursue grander work.

Arriving in Rexxentrum he quickly realized that reputable work didn't come easily, or easily enough and so to eat sometimes Sam would need to find ways to survive that weren't exactly legal.
