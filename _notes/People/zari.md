Zari is originally from the [[Velvin Thicket]] and is in search of a [[Winter Lotus]] to help deal with an illness from her village.

Some of the people of her village have mysteriously fallen into a coma like sleep. She believes that this plant can be used to bring them back.Â 

She's not sure if medicine or spell would work better yet.

Received her first plate armor from [[Sam Slippy Robbins]] and [[Raphael King Ambrosius Costeau]].
