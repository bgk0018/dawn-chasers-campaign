An organization  primarily centered in [[Yrrosa]] across the [[Dwendalian Empire]].

Primarily locally controlled, but there is a large infiltration of their headquarters that basically scattered the group. A lot of those satellite groups have been operating on their own and command and control has been trying to be re-established.

The Myriad have been making a resurgence in [[Rexentruum]] and it has been a concern of the [[Cerberus Assembly]].
