Conversation between [[Zassteeah Zass Maryis|Zaas]] and [[Raphael King Ambrosius Costeau|King]] about their magic and where it comes from:

[[Zassteeah Zass Maryis|Zaas]] i got me some help
[[Raphael King Ambrosius Costeau|King]] from home

[[Raphael King Ambrosius Costeau|King]] goes to sleep and dreams of home and hears renaissance music
	- See 2 hulking figures in his house
	- Parents no where to be found
	- Someone sitting in his father's chair
		- Welcome home Cousteau
		- Mademoiselle where are my parents
	- Parents are sick
	- mademoiselle 'ignoring the people' per [[Raphael King Ambrosius Costeau|King]]
	- 'Everyone in town is sick, what are you doing'
		- It's all for the common good
	- "I thought I got out"
		- Maybe released

[[Raphael King Ambrosius Costeau|King]]'s parents walk in and embrace him. They seem to be completely healthy

"See, perfect pictures of health" - mademoiselle

[[Jacqueline]] is mademoiselle.

Both parents let out a scream, hair starts popping out of their forearms, they have lycanthropy, wererats

Dream continues after [[Raphael King Ambrosius Costeau|King]] is assaulted by his parents in wererat form and the [[Silent Helm]]s

He transports to [[Castile Renee]] in the dream

[[Raphael King Ambrosius Costeau|King]] goes down and he hears 'bring me the flower and this can all be a bad dream'

[[Raphael King Ambrosius Costeau|King]] wakes up with a start.

Talk with [[Raphael King Ambrosius Costeau|King]] about his dream, lets [[Sam Slippy Robbins|Sam]] know about his sick parents and the [[Winter Lotus]] being useful for his parents the same one that [[Zari]] is looking for, for the [[Velvin Thicket]].

[[Sulk]] sleeps weird with his butt in the air.

[[Sulk]] gives [[Zari]] the [[Boots of the Winterlands]] as a thank you for keeping him alive in battle with [[Captain Skath]].
