**Encounter:**

- Arrive at [[Caer Dineval]]
- Ferry has been stopped and residents are upset that they can't get imports from [[Goodmead]]
- We tried to get a rest at the [[The Uphill Climb]] which is the local tavern
- [[The Uphill Climb]] said they were full for the night even though they didn't look like they were actually full
- [[Raphael King Ambrosius Costeau|King]] and [[Zassteeah Zass Maryis|Zaas]] are going back in to the [[The Uphill Climb]], invisible and as a different looking person
- [[Zassteeah Zass Maryis|Zaas]] talks with the bartender, and he says they aren't getting much travel right now and there isn't a lot of work right now even at the dock
- According to [[Roark]], the speaker of [[Caer Dineval]] has fallen ill, and it's not something he wanted to elaborate on more
- [[Raphael King Ambrosius Costeau|King]] notes that even the locals don't seem to be straying out
- [[Roark]] whispers to [[Zassteeah Zass Maryis|Zaas]] it's not safe, and we really shouldn't stay here
- There's something going on at the keep
- [[Zassteeah Zass Maryis|Zaas]] sees there are some heavy footprints outside of the inn, they are of dwarven make
- The footprints head west and skirt the edge of town
- We follow the footprints
- [[Raphael King Ambrosius Costeau|King]] notes a jet black, shiney, lump of rock, very familiar, looks similar to the weapon [[Sulk]] picked up, made out of [[Chardalyn]].
- The footprints take a few alleyways into the town, leading to [[The Dinev's Rest]] which is an old inn and has been out of business for some time
- Don't see any thieves cant nearby
- Do see writing in [[Undercommon]], a few symbols, but not everything is familiar
	- It's the [[Duergar]] language
- [[Sam Slippy Robbins|Sam]] sees 2 individuals, hear 2 others inside
