**Objective:** 

Talk our way out of being eaten.

**Encounter:**

- [[Sam Slippy Robbins|Sam]], [[Sulk]], and [[Raphael King Ambrosius Costeau|King]] taken into camp
	- [[Zari]] and [[Zassteeah Zass Maryis|Zaas]] undiscovered currently
	- There's an unsettling cooked smell
	- Saw some of the wolves we encountered earlier
	- We see a very large carved out of ice yeti statue
	- Probably 30-40 total people
- Head into the main tent
	- There's a pale white blue grow eminating from the gentleman who sits in front of us
	- [[Isarr Kronenstrom]] is the dude, the current tribal chieftain of the [[Wolf Clan]]
- The white lady ([[Frost Maiden]]) gives [[Isarr Kronenstrom]] power, the wolf was 'weak'
- [[Frost Maiden]] is in a frost castle he found
	- Was tested and now has power from [[Frost Maiden]]
- Was told to kill the druid in the room, we refuse
- We pick a fight with [[Isarr Kronenstrom]]
	- It goes not well but we end up getting through it
- Get a message from the [[Volstrucker]]s
	- [[Naerth Maxildanarr|Naerth]] let them know that there are signs that [[Avaris]] is headed towards the coast. She's apparently looking for for something called [[The Codicil of White]].
- [[Taryn]] is the druid's name
	- Would be happy to help
	- They need to recoup some here
	- [[The Codicil of White]] is possibly on the [[Dark Duchess]]
	- [[Dark Duchess]] is stuck in ice and it's unlikely sea worthy
- We want to get to [[Eiselcross]] but we likely need to cross [[Seas of Moving Ice]]
	- There's rumors of a creature that can get you across called an [[Angajuk]]
	- We can find it on the coast near a pier that's close to the [[Dark Duchess]]
