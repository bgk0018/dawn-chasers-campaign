**Objective:** 
Learn about the [[Chardalyn]] in the [[The Dinev's Rest]]

**Encounter:**

- [[Zassteeah Zass Maryis|Zaas]] Found a note written by [[Nildar Sunblight]] about when the [[Chardalyn]] would be delivered to the outpost at the latest the next fortnight. Mentions in passing the drunken speaker [[Trovus]]. Secrecy isn't as much of a concern when dealing with the drunkard.
- We think the outpost is likely near [[Caer-Konig]].
- [[Sam Slippy Robbins|Slippy]] offers to go run recon on the keep by himself
- [[Zassteeah Zass Maryis|Zaas]] follows somewhat closely behind
- [[Sam Slippy Robbins|Slippy]] uses disguise self as a guard and unsummons [[Mr Feely]]
- [[Sam Slippy Robbins|Slippy]] sees people on the ramparts of the keep
- [[Sam Slippy Robbins|Slippy]] makes his way along the right side of the keep wall
- See a kennel boy with the dogs along the back of the keep
- See a guardsman in the tower who is also asleep via [[Mr Feely]]
- The guardsman has a black pendant around his neck of a sword
- Intimidate the kennel boy into leaving me alone
- See an old dwarf sitting asleep in a rocking chair
- 3rd window over see a bed chamber, see another person with a black sword pendant standing at the door guarding what looks like an older human man, doesn't look in the best of health, frail
- Kennel boy name is [[Allisar Soulmander]]
	- Came here a few months ago, and decided to let him stay here and keep the dogs
- We have about 15 pounds of [[Chardalyn]]
- [[Raphael King Ambrosius Costeau|King]] "What are our goals with the [[Cult]] [[Zassteeah Zass Maryis|Zaas]]?"
	- [[Zassteeah Zass Maryis|Zaas]] maybe we can have these people become informants for us and we can take over
- [[Zassteeah Zass Maryis|Zaas]] dressed as a local guard intimidates [[Roark]]
- [[Roark]] hints at the fact that the current speaker has effectively been deposed by the [[Cult]] and the city is currently being run by the cult
- On the way out [[Roark]] says '[[Levistus]] be with you'
	- The amulets vibrate in response
- [[Zassteeah Zass Maryis|Zaas]] thinks that [[Levistus]] could be listening through the amulets and warns the group by writing on a piece of paper
- We approach the front of the keep and convince the guards to let us in by showing the [[Chardalyn]]
	- The guards don't see happy to see it and call it terrible
- Underneath the tower at the keep is a red fish
- We meet a gentleman that looks like a dandy
- [[Zassteeah Zass Maryis|Zaas]] lies to him about their purpose
- [[Zassteeah Zass Maryis|Zaas]] tells him she was here for the fire and that she ended up leaving with her life and met other like minded people
- Gentleman shows her his frostburns
	- He found himself in the middle of the tundra and he was lost and had run out of food and didn't have any dry wood to make water
	- He was definitely about to die and that's when he heard a voice, if he only dedicated his life to [[Levistus]] and forwarding his need in [[Tentown]]s then he'd continue to live and serve a purpose
	- When he awoke the next morning he found the amulet around his neck, every follower of [[Levistus]] has the same amulet
- [[Cult]] and [[Levistus]] doesn't like the [[Duergar]]
- [[Caer Dineval]] is the headquarters for the cult
- "Did you wipe out all of the [[Duergar]] in the town?"
	- All but one
	- He was excited about the fact that we were able to mark a blow against the [[Duergar]]
- The gentleman doesn't know what the [[Duergar]] want with the [[Chardalyn]], he thinks that they want to use it to hold dominion over [[Caer Dineval]]
- The gentleman  mentions that we should partake in the keeps hospitality
- The gentleman's name is [[Cadroth the Fiery]]
