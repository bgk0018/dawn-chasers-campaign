**Objective:** 

Convince the [[Volstrucker]]s not to interfere with our current plans.

**Encounter:**
- We try to bargain, it doesn't go well
- We agree to message everyday the [[Volstrucker]]s
- We have 5 days to get the book back from [[Avaris]]
- We stay at the tower for 8-12 hours, search the area and inside thoroughly
	- Find some books inside about the Frost Maiden
		- Learn that she was outcast and was one of the lesser betrayer gods
		- She was one of the ones that had been assumed to have been destroyed thus no record of her being locked away
		- She rides on a Roc and creates the aurora at night casting the everlasting Rime to keep it ever night
	- Teleporting leaves a residue or mark
	- We also notice where she spent most of her time in the bottom floor
		- We destroyed most of that bottom floor however
		- She destroyed another piece of arcane machinery that looked like it was used for a resurrection to bring the mage slayer back
	- Found some charred notes, mention of [[Netherill]], another floating city aside from [[Aeor]]
- Started travelling headed north to try and find [[Avaris]]
	- Found as frozen group of 20 people
		- It was a caravan and was ambushed
		- Missing body parts, seems purposeful
			- Tongue is missing
			- Pieces of the thigh the quad
			- Ribs
			- Literally cuts of meat
		- There is absurd gore, over the ridge, [[Sulk]] see's a white wolf with gold glowing eyes over the rise
			- It leads us to a body with a spear with a cloth, the man is dead and was a part of [[Sulk]]'s tribe
