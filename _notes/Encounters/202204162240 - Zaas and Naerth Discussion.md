**Objective:** Find out how the [[Dawn Chasers]] can work with [[Naerth Maxildanarr]]

**Encounter:**
- [[Zassteeah Zass Maryis]] reveals we know about the death of [[Prudence]]
- [[Naerth Maxildanarr]] states that they haven't been able to determine the method of [[Prudence]]'s death, but he's clearly lying
- [[Naerth Maxildanarr]] has a flash of recognition when [[Zassteeah Zass Maryis]] mentions the [[Cult]]
- [[Naerth Maxildanarr]] has heard of our work in [[Easthaven]] and that he'd mentioned [[Torga]] previously and that we'd apprehended her and that we'd come across a murderer as well
- [[Naerth Maxildanarr]] wants to talk about our services tomorrow
